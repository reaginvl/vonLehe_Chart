        EMS leaders say the decision leaves EMTs overworked, underpaid and often alone on dangerous calls as 911 response times continue to slow across the city.

        <p>911 response times have slowed down in recent years due to Emergency Medical Services staffing shortages. But, Gov. Kathy Hochul vetoed a bill this October, which could have eased risk for the high-stress job.</p>
        <p>The bill would’ve required two EMS-certified personnel to attend ambulances and supervisor vehicles, meant to boost applicants, steady employee retention and speed up response times.</p>
        <p>Medical emergency calls currently have either two EMT’s or paramedics on the scene along with the police officers or firefighters. EMS supervisors provide guidance to other first responders for calls that could potentially need medical attention.</p>
        <p>With the staffing shortages, supervisors have stepped in to respond to calls when there aren’t enough ambulances on the road. But, supervisors can’t give medical attention by themselves, which the bill would have solved by adding another EMT or paramedic to the supervisor vehicle.</p>
        <p>“We’re so desperate for manpower—we can’t keep up with demand and people are resigning every day,” Barzilay said. “Calls start to pile up and they’re placed on hold until a unit becomes available.”</p>
        <p>The Fire Department of New York also has the power to lower the required number of medical responders per vehicle to one EMT or one paramedic to get more ambulances on the road.</p>

        <p>Oren Barzilay, president of FDNY EMS Local 2507—the union representing more than 4,000 EMTs and paramedics—said they’re protecting themselves from FDNY.</p>
        <p>EMS has had low employee retention rates since the pandemic, because workers realized they respond to the same fires, shootings and mental health emergencies that firefighters and police officers do. But, they do it for less than half the pay.</p>
        <p>FDNY EMS pays minimum wage—$18 an hour—and loses roughly 20% of its workforce every year. Surrounding areas like Nassau County in Long Island offer EMS workers a $140,000 salary.</p>
        <p>“The risk that we are exposed to on a routine day is violence against our men and women with no breaks and constant demand of us working overtime,” Barzilay said. “[People resign after] they realize this is a dead-end.”</p>

        <p>Average response times to life-threatening medical emergencies in 2020 were between a little over nine minutes in Manhattan and almost 11 minutes in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>There has been a spike that started in 2023, with Manhattan reaching the second slowest spot at 12 minutes and the Bronx still reigning with over 13 minutes.</p>

        <p>He attributed the screeching slowdown to lower speed limits, more bike lanes and the narrowing of city streets.</p>
        <p>He’s seen response times of seven hours for non-life-threatening calls and over thirty minutes for emergencies like cardiac arrest. Those patients’ chance of survival decreases by 10% each minute and permanent brain damage can occur after five, according to the Cleveland Clinic.</p>

      <section class="section-block">
        <p>Despite this, FDNY urged Hochul to veto the bill, saying it would redirect EMT’s to supervisor vehicles and actually slow response times.</p>
        <p>The union claims this isn’t true, as the bill would allow supervisor vehicles to respond and speed up arrival on the scene.</p>
        <p>Hochul’s veto memo said the proposed law would require adding 290 more EMT’s, costing the state an additional annual cost of $25 million. But, the EMS union noted just <span class="stat">14%</span> of FDNY’s current $2.6 million budget goes toward EMS—down 16.2% from last fiscal year.</p>

      <section class="section-block">
        <p>The legislation was inspired by the 2022 murder of Fire Department of New York EMS Lt. Alison Russo.</p>
        <p>61-year-old Russo was working as a supervisor alone in a city-issued vehicle when she was attacked outside her station house in Queens.</p>
        <p>“Firefighters and policemen never ride alone—we are the only service that will send out a supervisor by themselves,” Barzilay said. “It places us in harm's way as we go through the most high-crime neighborhoods at night and it’s simply not safe to send them alone.”</p>
